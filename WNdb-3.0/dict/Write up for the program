**Part 1: Idea Generation and Vetting**

**Brainstormed Ideas:**
1. **Word Dictionary Search**  
   - Structure: Build a dictionary where words are keys and their definitions are the values.  
   - Sorting: Organize the dictionary alphabetically by keys.  
   - Binary Search: Use binary search to find a specific wordâ€™s position in the sorted dictionary. If found, return its definition.

2. **University Course Search**  
   - Structure: Create a list of courses, each containing attributes like course name, department, and prerequisites.  
   - Sorting: Sort the list by course name or department.  
   - Binary Search: Use binary search to find a specific course by name or department, and return its details.

3. **Restaurant Menu Search**  
   - Structure: Design a menu list with attributes like item name, category, and price.  
   - Sorting: Sort the menu by item name or category.  
   - Binary Search: Use binary search to find a specific menu item or category, returning its details.

Prompt for AI - - - project idea using binary search with python as a student, don't explain detail yet ,just give the idea at least 4 different, not too long to code , something interesting to learn more about python binary search

**AI-Prompted Ideas**:
1. **Number Guessing Game**: A binary search-driven game where the computer guesses the user's number.  
2. **Sorted List Search**: Search a user-inputted sorted list of numbers for a specific target using binary search.  
3. **Book Index Finder**: Search for book titles or chapters in a sorted list using binary search.  
4. **Temperature Log Search**: Search temperature readings (sorted by date) to find the first occurrence below or above a certain threshold.

**Final Decision**:  
After group discussions and feedback from the professor, we chose to work on **Word Search in a Dictionary**. It's a classic and simple approach, allowing us to focus on implementing binary search without too many complexities.

**Part 2: Project Breakdown**  
- We'll use a local text file for the dictionary, initially searching for dictionary files online.  
- Alternatively, we may call an API to look up words if needed.  
- The output will feature these options:

**Dictionary Menu:**
1. Look up a word
2. Find a random word
3. Exit  
*Enter your choice:*
